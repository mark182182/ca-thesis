 * Evolve the given partitioned space to the next generation for 3D rendering.
 *
 * The default rules for 2D can be applied, but in 3D there are many more
 * neighbours, so most configurations quickly die out. Because of this, the
 * rules that are implemented are usually are different for Game of Life in 3D.
 *
 * These were most notably researched by Carter Bays, which is generally called
 * "3D Life". These are different rulesets which support more stable and complex
 * patterns that don't go extinct that rapidly.
 *
 * From his work "Candidates for the Game of Life in Three Dimensions" the
 * rulesets are defined by the number of minimum and maximum neighbours that a
 * living cell needs to survive El九九u and the number of minimum and maximum
 * neighbours that a living cell needs to reproduce is Fl了了u. This is usually
 * written in the form of R(El, Eu, Fl, Fu).
 *
 * Examples:
 * Rule R = (5766): A living cell survives if it has 5, 6, or 7 neighbours. It
 * dies if it has fewer than 5 or more than 7. A dead cell becomes alive if it
 * has 6 neighbours.
 *
 * Rule R = (4555): A living cell survives if it has 4 or 5 neighbours. It dies
 * if it has fewer than 4 or more than 5. A
 * dead cell becomes alive if it has 5 neighbours.
